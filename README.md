## Congratulations! You found me here!

### So, I'm gonna share you a little bit more about me.

- 会说中文。/English is also OK./日本語がちょっとできる。（また勉強しますから）
- Currently I'm living in Guangzhou, China as a student and studying mathematics.
- As you expected, I'm a kinda *pseudo*-fullstack developer. I do all kind of stuffs that are computer-related, from frontend to backend, even reverse-engineering.
- Please note that I'm super-duper lazy. I might not respond messages in time unless something emergent.
- I'm a rookie illustrator so you may expect me to post some random illustrator on my SNS. (Yes, I have a Twitter account with the same name.)
- Donate me via XMR if you're interested. I can't promise you something in return tho: 49nBuMBAsdpd6rVcfCZ94SGEXtZWaSJsUEg7zHXVC5j4GfN9PRmy5UEQ9MLf7VRgv9VgsV4MAUrBicidsC3CFjdVSbj4v7Z
