### Congratulations! You have found me!

### So, I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about me.

- 中文/English/日本語が少し (<-あの、私はまだ日本語を勉強します。間張ります！)
- Currently I'm living in Guangzhou and studying mathematics.
- As you expected, I'm some kind of *pseudo*-fullstack developer. Hence you may consider that everything will appear here in my repositories.
- Please note that I'm a super-duper lazy dog. I might not respond messages in time.
- I'm a rookie illustrator so you may expect me to post some random illustrator on my SNS. (Yes, I have a Twitter account with the same name.)
- Donate via XMR accepted: 49nBuMBAsdpd6rVcfCZ94SGEXtZWaSJsUEg7zHXVC5j4GfN9PRmy5UEQ9MLf7VRgv9VgsV4MAUrBicidsC3CFjdVSbj4v7Z
